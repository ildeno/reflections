How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug
that was introduced?

R - Because I could to have edited something of wrong. 
In our latest example I wrote "spacr" instead of "space". 
This was just a typo, but what if I would to write a long line of code?


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

R - Writing long code is not easy, and find bugs inside of it is worst. So
we can use a version control and if something wrong happens, we can find and
correct the bug easily just come back to the interested point


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?

R - If I'm unluky and the power goes down :'(. Anyway saving manually let me
chose a checkpoint I think is better. So I can choose to save in 5 minutes,
but also choose to save after one hour or two of job.. The choice is mine


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?

R - Because, speaking about programming, we would to change more than one
single 
file. It seems to be reasonable


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of
files?

R - Use "git log" first. Doing that, we can to know every single commit ID and
use it (and another) to read all the edited lines


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

R - Because commiting my job when I need, I can go back using checkout


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git
for?

R - Obviously I'd like to try it editing the Asteroids errors
