What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

R - It is necessary init a new repository because git creates new files, which
it is possible to keep track of all changes (.git)


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

R - I don't really know


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

R - Because I can choose to commit only the files that have a logical
connection..
Maybe
