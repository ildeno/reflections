When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

R - When my work is shared probably I need to work togheter many persons all around the world


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

R - Because it would cause a lot of overhead. I would to change locally my
files
and only when I'm sure of my work upload my job



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

R - Forks creates a copy among github repositories. A clone copy (litterally
clone) the whole repository. A branch is a way to edit the existing code.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

R - I suppose because it is more easy to remember my last work... But is
stupid
